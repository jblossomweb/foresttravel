Accurate and Uncluttered / Organized coding
Organization of Files and Folders
-----------------

PHP

Organize the following list of items into an array variable.
Fruit: Apple
Color: Yellow
Number: 7
Modify the 3rd element from the above array by multiplying the value 7 to equal 21 using an equation.
Convert the array variable created above into JSON and save into a new variable.
Decode the above JSON variable back to a normal array and echo to browser using a foreach loop in an unordered list.
Place a condition inside the foreach loop so that the value in the 2nd element is displayed in lowercase.
CSS

Style the above unordered list as per the following instructions:
List Style None
Display each list item as block
Give each list item a background Color
Change background color on Hover
Add a 20px margin between each list item
Center text
jQuery

Upon clicking the first list item replace the word “Apple” with “Orange”
Upon hovering the mouse over the second list item change its background color to some other color.
Upon clicking the third list item have it fade away and reappear above the first item.
MySQL

Create a database with the following:
4 Columns
id
label
value
timestamp (default value = current_timestamp)
Add a link below the unordered list that would save the list items into the database as separate rows in the order in which they are displayed - using jQuery ajax:
Example:
id = 1, label = Fruit, value = Orange
id = 2, label = Color, value = Yellow
id = 3, label = Number, value = 7
